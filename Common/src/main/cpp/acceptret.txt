       EAGAIN or EWOULDBLOCK
              The socket is marked nonblocking and no connections are present to be accepted.  POSIX.1-2001 and POSIX.1-2008 allow either error to be returned for this case, and do
              not require these constants to have the same value, so a portable application should check for both possibilities.


       ECONNABORTED
              A connection has been aborted.

       EINTR  The system call was interrupted by a signal that was caught before a valid connection arrived; see signal(7).
       EMFILE The per-process limit on the number of open file descriptors has been reached.
       ENOBUFS, ENOMEM
              Not enough free memory.  This often means that the memory allocation is limited by the socket buffer limits, not by the system memory.
       EPERM  Firewall rules forbid connection.










       EBADF  sockfd is not an open file descriptor.
       EINVAL Socket is not listening for connections, or addrlen is invalid (e.g., is negative).
       ENOTSOCK
              The file descriptor sockfd does not refer to a socket.
       EOPNOTSUPP
              The referenced socket is not of type SOCK_STREAM.

       EFAULT The addr argument is not in a writable part of the user address space.
       EPROTO Protocol error.
